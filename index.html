                    <p>Since I was first appointed to the bench in 2011 by Governor 
                    Sandoval and later elected in 2012, I have worked hard to 
                    validate the trust placed in me as your District Court Judge 
                    in Department 5.  I know our legal system works only when the 
                    system is fair and impartial to all, and the public places great 
                    faith in the judges they elect to ensure that the system operates 
                    without bias. I am honored by the trust placed in me, and believe 
                    that my record will show that I have upheld that trust.</p>
 
                    <p>Since the goal of a trial is the fair and just resolution of 
                    disputes, judges need a thorough understanding of the rules of 
                    evidence, keen analytical abilities, excellent oral and written 
                    skills, a calm and respectful manner towards others, the ability 
                    to empathize with the concerns and personal challenges of the 
                    participants, and a broad understanding of the law.  These skills 
                    are only acquired through many years of experience as a practicing 
                    lawyer.</p>
 
                    <p>During my thirty-four years of legal practice, I have been 
                    fortunate to have practiced extensively in both the criminal 
                    and civil arenas, and in each of those areas I have represented 
                    parties on both sides – prosecution and defense, plaintiff and 
                    defendant. This experience gives me the broad background needed 
                    to handle the variety of cases brought in Clark County's District 
                    Courts.</p>
 
                    <p>When I took the bench in mid-October of 2011, Department 5 had 
                    a backlog of cases, and so my top priority at that time was to 
                    reduce the backlog through the hard work of moving cases expeditiously 
                    though the system.  By the end of 2012 I had achieved that goal and 
                    returned Department 5’s docket to a working status compliant with the 
                    case management goals set by the Eighth Judicial District Court.  
                    The public rightly expects its judges to render just and reasoned 
                    decisions in every case and to save litigants needless time and 
                    expense occasioned by unnecessary delay.  It remains one of my top 
                    priorities to continue meeting these important expectations.</p>
 
                    <p>Three decades of legal practice have taught me many things in 
                    addition to the law – among them patience, civility, empathy, 
                    and respect for others no matter their individual circumstances. 
                    I will continue to use all that I have learned should I again 
                    be honored with the public’s trust in being re-elected as a 
                    Judge on the District Court bench.</p>
 
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and learn 
                    more about my background and qualifications.  I hope to retain 
                    your trust and once again earn your vote.</p>
