                    <p>Prior to her appointment, Judge Ellsworth had practiced law in 
                    Clark County, Nevada, since 1980.  She received her Juris 
                    Doctorate from Southwestern University School of Law in 1979 
                    and joined the Clark County District Attorney’s Office in 1979, 
                    serving first as an appellate law clerk and then a Deputy 
                    District Attorney and Chief Deputy District Attorney.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="large-12 columns text">
                    <p>During her 11 years in the District Attorney’s Office, she 
                    headed the Office's Consumer Fraud Unit and later the Major Fraud 
                    Unit. She also prosecuted hundreds of felony cases, including capital 
                    murder prosecutions; served as one of the two deputies designated 
                    to respond to suspected arsons; and wrote the office’s protocol for 
                    the handling of child sexual assault cases. During this same period 
                    Judge Ellsworth was appointed as a Special Assistant United States 
                    Attorney to assist the Department of Agriculture in the prosecution 
                    of fraud cases, and she taught a semester course in Criminal evidence 
                    at the Clark County Community College.</p>

                    <p>In 1990, Judge Ellsworth left her position with the District Attorney’s 
                    Office to assume the position of Assistant General Counsel to Mirage Resorts 
                    Incorporated, and Vice president and General Counsel to Mirage Resorts 
                    Risk Management.  In those roles, she served as the chief in-house 
                    litigation counsel for Mirage Resorts and its many operating subsidiary 
                    companies, trying civil lawsuits in jury trials, handling workers 
                    compensation litigation, and supervising the risk management legal department.</p>
 
                    <p>After a decade in corporate practice, in 2000, Judge Ellsworth 
                    entered general private practice where she emphasized representation 
                    of employees in wrongful termination cases, including age, race and 
                    gender discrimination matters.  Being a private pilot herself, she 
                    also developed a practice in aviation litigation representing both 
                    plaintiffs and defendants in cases involving aircraft accidents.</p>
 
                    <p>In 2007, Judge Ellsworth joined the Nevada Secretary of State’s 
                    Office, Securities Division, as its Chief of Enforcement.  In 
                    2009, she was appointed by Secretary of State Ross Miller as 
                    the Administrator of the Securities Division, enforcing Nevada’s 
                    securities laws, investigating complex criminal fraud cases for 
                    prosecution, supervising a staff of 20, and conducting investigations 
                    concerning alleged voter fraud. </p>
 
                    <p>Since her appointment as a District Court Judge, Judge Ellsworth has 
                    developed a reputation as being a hardworking, knowledgeable, fair 
                    and courteous judge who works tirelessly for the citizens of Clark 
                    County. She has guest lectured at various law firms and UNLV, and 
                    volunteered as a judge in Mock Trial presentations at Boyd Law School 
                    and the undergraduate program at UNLV. She has also been an active 
                    participant in the State Bar’s Transitioning Into Practice mentoring program.</p>
